Title: Old English

I have a bit of a passion for Old English, also known as Anglo-Saxon. This page
lists some of the things I've created as part of that interest.

### An Old English (Anglo-Saxon) speech synthesiser

An attempt to learn about the [eSpeak](http://espeak.sourceforge.net/) speech
synthesiser and speech synthesis in general. Require an MP3-supporting browser
such as Chrome. (Firefox does not support MP3 in the HTML ``audio`` tag.)
