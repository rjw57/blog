Title: Contact Me

## General

I'm best contacted in the first instance by sharing your query with me on
[Google+](https://plus.google.com/114005052144439249039/posts). If you have
something specific to say about on of my GitHub projects, it is best to open an
issue on it directly. I can be emailed via ``firstname@firstnamelastname.com``
replacing ``firstname`` with my first name and, shockingly, ``lastname`` with
my last name.

I do not use the telephone.

## Recruitment

I get more than perhaps my fair share of 'recruitment' spam but if you insist,
my [curriculum vit&aelig;](http://rjw57.github.io/cv) is available.
