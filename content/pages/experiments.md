Title: Experiments

This page lists some of the experiments I've made in order to learn new bits of
technology or new programming languages.

### Proj4WebGL

An experiment in hardware-accelerated geographic co-ordinate reprojection in the
browser.

### Some notes on interesting things

A selection of single-page notes on Mathematical or Technical 'doodles' which
I come accross in my day-to-day life.

the BBC website.

### A (fairer) colouring of the 2010 UK General Election results

A map of the UK coloured according to the *proportion* of votes for each party
and not by the winner of the seat.
